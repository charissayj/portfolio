						<h1>So, Who Am I?</h1>
						<p>I am a full-stack web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, Python with Flask and Django, and MEAN. I learned many of my technical skills from Coding Dojo in Dallas. Coding Dojo is an immersive 14-week coding boot camp that teaches students the languages and tools they need to know to create websites from the front end to the back end. Prior to Coding Dojo, I completed over 140 credit hours at DeVry University and American Military University where I initially sought a degree in Biomedical Sciences but later switched to Computer Information Systems.</p>
						<p><span>Why the switch?</span> For the past eight years, I have served in the US military as a medic. It was a great job, I met plenty of great people, and learned a lot. As my time in the military drew to an end I knew that it was time for me to move on from the medical field and pursue a career that I was more passionate about. Enter software development. I always enjoyed things like solving puzzles and building things, but I had never considered that I could have a career doing basically those things. Once I learned more about software and web development and realized that I could have a challenging and fulfilling career building (and sometimes breaking) software and websites I knew I had found my passion. Even in my free time, you can find me writing code!</p>
